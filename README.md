## Challenges

Start with the code here and try these challenges: 

- Add styles. There are a few areas you can style!
	- Improve the styles on the Grid component
	- Improve the styles on the ColorPicker Component. Add a label, style the label, and hide input.
	- Style the layout of the components. Do this in App
- The sample color swatch in ColorPicker could show it's color by checking the color from the Reduc Store. This would allow you to remove it from the ColorPicker and put anywhere in the App. 
- Add an option to set the height and width of the grid.
- Persist the drawing by saving the data to local storage.
